# Space Game 

Space Game is one of my first game made with XNA. It's a space shoot them up with 4 ships, 2 levels and some enemies.
Because it's one of my first games, it's bugged, the code is not very optimized and there are some comments in French.

This is the XNA version adapted to work with MonoGame. Sources can contains references to Windows Phone 7, 8 and Windows Metro.
